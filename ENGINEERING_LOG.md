# CodeAgent — Engineering Log

Per `docs/CODEAGENT_LLM_HANDOFF.md`: one entry per meaningful session,
recording intended outcome, decisions made (with rejected alternatives
where a real choice existed), evidence/verification, and the next
smallest step. Kept terse — this is a decision trail, not a narrative.
Formal, durable architectural decisions are promoted to `docs/adr/`;
this log covers the full granularity of trade-offs behind them.

---

## Session: Milestone 0 — domain state machine (initial)

**Outcome**: `src/codeagent/domain.py` + exhaustive tests.

- Decided the state machine (`INIT→BASELINE→EXPLORE→PLAN→APPROVAL→
  EXECUTE→VERIFY→DONE`) and tool-legality-per-state as a pure,
  side-effect-free module — no budgets/counters here, so the state
  machine can be exhaustively tested independently of controller logic
  that doesn't exist yet.
- Initially included `run_process` as a model-callable tool during
  `EXPLORE`. On review, removed it entirely before any process
  dispatcher/policy existed to bound it — recorded as ADR 0001, since
  it narrows the model's capability versus the original design docs.
- Verification: 217 tests passing at this point (later revised).

## Session: Milestone 0 — domain corrections (approval loop, budget split, enum stability)

**Outcome**: added `PLAN_REVISION_REQUESTED`, `TransitionResult`,
split `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` into three specific terminal reasons.

- Added a second approval outcome (revision-requested, distinct from
  reject) — creates a second uncapped repair-style loop alongside the
  verify-failure loop; both caps are explicitly deferred to
  `budgets.py` (unbuilt), not enforced in `domain.py`.
- Split `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` into `REPAIR_ITERATIONS_EXHAUSTED`/
  `COST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`/`WALL_CLOCK_EXCEEDED` to satisfy the completion
  criteria's cost/latency reporting requirement.
- **Reverted in the next session** — see below. Recorded here so the
  reasoning for *both* directions is visible, not just the final state.

## Session: Milestone 0 — event schemas (initial) + budget-taxonomy revert

**Outcome**: `src/codeagent/events.py` (first pass), domain.py's
budget split reverted.

- Reverted the 3-way budget-trigger split back to one generic
  `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` trigger/terminal-reason, adding `BudgetKind` (6
  members) instead. Rationale: the *state machine* only needs to know
  a budget ended the run; which budget is an event-payload concern
  (`BudgetExceeded.kind`), not a state-machine concern. Kept the
  domain layer's vocabulary minimal.
- Added `ApprovalDecision`/`ApprovalMode` as dedicated enums rather
  than overloading `Trigger` for approval outcomes — rejected reusing
  `Trigger` because it would accept all 14 members and reject most at
  construction time; a narrower type is a static-typing win, not just
  a runtime check.
- Verification: after the revert, re-ran the full domain suite to
  confirm exhaustive coverage survived intact (209/209), not just that
  it compiled — this was an explicit ask, and matters because a revert
  is exactly the kind of change that silently drops test coverage if
  you're not careful.

## Session: Milestone 0 — event-schema correction pass (exit codes, canonical JSON, budgets, common validation)

**Outcome**: exit-code-per-outcome rules, canonical JSON for tool
arguments, `BudgetExceeded.projected_value`, stronger common
validation (finite floats, aware timestamps, nonempty-if-present IDs).

- Defined a project-specific canonical JSON form (sorted keys, compact
  separators, Unicode preserved, duplicate keys and NaN/Infinity
  rejected) for `redacted_arguments_json` — explicit that this makes
  two independently-produced JSON strings comparable byte-for-byte in
  the log; it is *not* a redaction implementation, and the log says so
  in three places (module docstring, field comment, this entry).
- Added `projected_value` to `BudgetExceeded` to support proactive
  budget enforcement (block before overspending, not just report
  after) — `observed_value` (actual) and `projected_value` (if the
  denied operation proceeded) are now both meaningful, independently
  validated fields.
- Verification: 394 tests passing, plus a manual smoke script
  exercising every new invariant *before* the corresponding test file
  was written, specifically so the tests were checked against
  confirmed behavior rather than written on faith.

## Session: Milestone 0 — error taxonomy (design review, then implementation)

**Outcome**: `src/codeagent/errors.py`, `ModelRequestFailed` event,
per-event error-field validation matrices.

- First taxonomy draft used `ErrorCategory` (RECOVERABLE_OPERATIONAL /
  TERMINAL_OPERATIONAL) baked onto each `ErrorCode`. **Rejected on
  review** — this contradicts the stated principle that retry/
  terminate depends on controller state, budgets, and attempt count,
  none of which the taxonomy has visibility into. Replaced with
  `ErrorDomain` (purely descriptive: what kind of thing failed, no
  disposition implied).
- Compared three ways to represent "the model provider never returned
  a response at all": (a) make `ModelResponseReceived.response_id`
  optional — rejected, would let one event mean two different things;
  (b) a generic `OperationFailed` event — rejected, breaks from the
  codebase's one-dataclass-per-EventType style and re-derives
  per-operation correlation-ID shape that the existing event pairs
  already give for free; (c) a new sibling event, `ModelRequestFailed`,
  correlated by `request_id` only — **chosen**.
- Decided not to add `error_id` to `OperationalError` — nothing in the
  current design needs one failure referenced from two events or
  deduplicated; existing correlation IDs + event sequence suffice.
  Explicit trigger for revisiting: the day a real cross-event reference
  need appears.
- Kept `UNCLASSIFIED_FAILURE` but bounded it to exactly one attachment
  point (`RunFinished` only) so it can't become a dumping ground — every
  other event requires a precise, domain-specific code because what
  happened is already known at the point that event is recorded.
- Verification: 537 tests, plus a manual smoke script per invariant
  before the test file, same discipline as the prior session.

## Session: Milestone 0 — narrow error-taxonomy correction pass

**Outcome**: `ToolCompleted`'s error-code legality now depends on
`tool`, not just `success`; corrected an overclaim in a docstring;
fixed a mismatched test name.

- `PATCH_VALIDATION_FAILED`/`PATCH_APPLICATION_FAILED` are only valid
  when `tool is ToolName.APPLY_PATCH` — a `read_file` failure can never
  legitimately claim a patch-specific code. Added an exhaustive
  (tool × code) partition test (75 cases) rather than trusting hand-picked
  examples.
- Removed an unsupported "exactly one, never neither" cardinality claim
  from `ModelRequestFailed`'s docstring — that discipline belongs to a
  controller/EventSink that doesn't exist yet; a started request can
  legitimately have no terminal event at all after a crash. Don't claim
  more than what's actually enforced.
- A test named for one thing was actually only checking `hasattr`, not
  the real import graph. Renamed it to match what it proves, and added
  a second, genuine import-graph check using `ast`/`inspect` (stdlib
  only, no new dependency) to confirm `domain.py` doesn't import
  `errors.py`.
- Verification: 677 tests passing.

## Session: Milestone 0 — threat model (draft)

**Outcome**: `docs/threat-model.md`, ~45 threat records across 14
categories, 9 explicit author trust-boundary decisions recorded inline.

- Corrected a claim that had been repeated informally across prior
  reports/commit messages: "the original repository is never touched."
  This is imprecise — Git worktrees **share** administrative metadata
  with the repo they're created from. The accurate claim, now the
  standing one: CodeAgent does not intentionally modify the original
  checkout's *working-copy files*; shared Git metadata is accessed only
  through controlled worktree operations. Use this framing in any
  future README/ADR/completion-criterion language, not the stronger
  one.
- Flagged 4 residual risks as genuinely requiring author sign-off
  rather than folding them into "accepted" silently: no redaction
  exists yet (live gap, not hypothetical); the dependency-prep phase's
  network window is irreducible while third-party dependency
  installation is supported; `approval_mode=none` is a real, accepted
  safety reduction, not a softened one; container escape is the single
  largest unmitigated residual risk in the document and should be
  stated as such, not hedged.
- Verification: N/A (documentation step, no code/tests touched this
  session per explicit instruction).

## Session: push to origin/main

**Outcome**: first commit since the repo's prior spike commit,
containing all of the above (domain/events/errors + tests + corrected
planning docs + ADR 0001), pushed to `origin/main` (`528ea8d`).

- Decided one combined commit rather than several, per explicit
  request, with a commit message written for both a technical and a
  non-technical reader (plain-language framing per section, technical
  specifics retained) — a deliberate choice given this is a portfolio
  project where the commit history itself is part of the evidence a
  reviewer sees.
- Gap identified in this same session (see the message that prompted
  this log's creation): several of the decisions above existed only in
  conversation, not in a durable file, until now. This log exists to
  close that gap going forward, not just retroactively.

## Session: threat model — ADR promotion + revision pass

**Outcome**: ADR 0002 written; `docs/threat-model.md` revised with four
resolved author decisions and several corrections.

- Promoted the budget-taxonomy design (ADR 0002) to a formal ADR; kept
  the `ModelRequestFailed` design at log-level only, per explicit
  author choice — not every compared-alternatives decision warrants a
  file, even a good one.
- Resolved the four flagged residual risks as **accepted, with
  conditions** rather than left open: redaction (T-G1) reframed as a
  hard security gate, not a scheduling note; the dependency-prep
  network window (T-H1) accepted with six explicit conditions
  (opt-in, ephemeral, isolated, auditable, sequenced before
  verification); `approval_mode=none` (T-I1) accepted only for curated
  CI/benchmark use, with a new sibling threat (T-I4) added specifically
  to block repository-supplied config from silently selecting it;
  container-escape (T-K1) reaffirmed in plain language, explicitly not
  to be softened in future public-facing docs.
- Corrected an overclaim: "pinned = trusted" for Docker images/
  dependencies is wrong — pinning gives reproducibility and
  drift-detection, not vetted trust. Fixed in the trusted/untrusted
  table and T-D1.
- Corrected another overclaim, systemically: ~15 "residual risk: none
  expected once implemented" lines overstated what a planned-but-
  unbuilt control could honestly promise. Replaced with language
  acknowledging implementation defects, undiscovered vulnerabilities,
  and configuration drift as ongoing possibilities, not resolved to
  zero by the mere existence of a plan.
- Added an executive summary and reframed O1-O7 as target objectives
  for the eventual system, not guarantees the current (mostly
  unbuilt) system already provides — the original draft risked
  reading as more complete than the codebase actually is.
- No new architecturally-consequential decision (beyond the two ADR
  candidates already triaged) surfaced in this pass — the changes are
  corrections and resolutions of the prior draft, not new designs.

## Session: Milestone 0 closure

**Outcome**: threat model and ADR 0002 accepted; Milestone 0's guide-defined
deliverables (domain types, state-transition table, event schemas, error
taxonomy, threat model, ADRs for consequential choices) are all present and
verified. 677 tests passing, `git diff --check` clean.

- Corrected ADR 0002's first consequence, which had wrongly claimed adding a
  budget dimension is an `events.py`/`budgets.py`-only change — `BudgetKind`
  actually lives in `domain.py`, so extending it (and its pinned-value
  tests) is part of that change too. The state-transition topology is still
  untouched, which was the actual point of the ADR.
- Clarified in `CLAUDE.md` that the current explicit user request always
  outranks the repository's documented authority order — that order only
  resolves conflicts among the documents themselves.
- Replaced "further ADRs are still owed" framing with a documentation
  ladder (ADR / ENGINEERING_LOG / code comment / issue register) so future
  sessions size the record to the decision instead of treating ADR count as
  a checklist to fill.
